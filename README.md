# BLOCKCHAIN OPERATION CONSOLE
The Operations console aggregates the operational activities required to manage the Blockchain network provisioned on the platform. The operational activities include Self-provisioning, monitoring health and membership management of Blockchain network. It will be used by Blockchain Network Owners, Auditors, and member operators.

## Functional Principles
Provide access integration to:
  - Monitoring capabilities for Blockchain network that includes health status, block activities, log files, etc
  - Membership management capabilities of the Blockchain network
  - Self-provisioning capabilities for the Blockchain network nodes
  - Auditing capabilities of the Blockchain network
  
## Architecture Overview

## Blockchain Networks

The blockchain networks to be suppoted for first release of ML BPaaS are: Ethereum, HyperLedger Fabric, NEM and MultiChain.

## APIs and SDK of Blockchain Networks


The following APIs will be used by the Blockchain Operation Console.
### Ethereum

The JSON-RPC references: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-java


### HyperLedger Fabric

Java SDK references: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-java

### NEM
